Neural Neuron Function
This Python script implements a simple artificial neuron function that takes two binary inputs (0 or 1), applies weights and bias, and outputs either 0 or 1 based on the weighted sum.

Description
The function weighted_sum_with_bias(x1, x2):

Multiplies inputs x1 and x2 by weights (both set to 5.0).

Adds a bias value (-5.0).

Returns:

1 if the sum is greater than or equal to 1.

0 otherwise.
